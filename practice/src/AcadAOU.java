 * Academic status of AOU students could be:
 * - "regular" if their GPA â‰¥ 2
 * - "warned" if their GPA < 2 and number of warnings they received < 5
 * - "dismissed" if their GPA < 2 and number of warnings they received = 5
 * Write a Java application that reads from user the GPA of a student as a real number and
 * number of warnings he/she received, then prints the academic status of the student.*/
